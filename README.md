### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
* Understanding and inputing COUNTIFS fomulas in Microsoft Excel for finding launch date outcomes
  * I was able to understand and input these formulas correctly after reaching out from support from office hours, and trial and error.
* Editing outcome charts on Excel so that they depict the data effectively.
  * I reviewed the challenge instructions, and through trial and error, I was able to work through this difficulty.
## Results

### Conclusions
* Outcomes based on launch date
  * The optimal time to launch a theater campaign is Early Summer (Between May and June).
  * The least optimal time to launch a theater campaign is in Winter (November, December, and January), possibly due to the holiday season.
* Outcomes based on funding goals
  * The most successful campaigns had funding goals set at less than $10000. 
  * Funding goals that were set over $45000, werek likely to be failed campaigns.

### Limitations
* One limitation to this analysis is the data may not reflect current socioeconomic enviornment relating to COVID-19 and the Delta variant, which may hinder outcomes for projects goals and launch date.
